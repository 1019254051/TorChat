TorChat
=======

TorChat is a peer to peer instant messenger with a completely decentralized design, 
built on top of Tor's location hidden services, giving you extremely strong anonymity 
while being very easy to use without the need to install or configure anything.

Please see the wiki page: https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/wiki for more information.
