## TorChat v2

This is a completely independent branch. 

It is a rewrite from scratch, using Lazarus + Free Pascal. 
This will make it easier to create plugins for existing 
IM applications and also allows to easily generate code 
for a wider range of platforms, especially mobile devices 
like Android and iPhone.
