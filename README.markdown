## TorChat v2

This is a completely independent branch. 

It is a rewrite from scratch, using Lazarus + Free Pascal. 
This will make it easier to create plugins for existing 
IM applications and also allows to easily generate code 
for a wider range of platforms, especially mobile devices 
like Android and iPhone.

At the moment this branch is mainly used to develop a plugin
for libpurple (the Pidgin-IM) which will be the first thing
that you can expect to come out of this branch, later (once
this works) there will also be a standalone GUI that will 
completely replace the current Python implementation. At this 
point this branch will become the master branch and the Python 
branch will reach the end of its life.
